# Sentiment Analysis

Development of a Sentiment Analysis methodology to add value to the business using customer comments.

## Abstract
An automatic methodology is proposed for extracting valuable information from
customer experience and online comments after they purchase products, including the prediction of negative opinions from written phrases and the estimation of potential savings from attending unsatisfied customers. The complete
methodology consists in natural language pre-processing, the calculation of the
Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) index, the construction of binary classification models for negative opinions, and the estimation
of the potential savings from using the knowledge extracted by the predicitve
models. The function for estimating the savings makes use of soft measures,
based on the fuzzy possibility representation of costs to handle the uncertainty
in unsatisfied clients to complain and ask for the payback of their purchase
(given that they are unsatisfied with the delivery). The prediction algorithms
for negative emotions are shown to achieve good results when tested with out-ofsample comments coming from social networks, and the complete methodology
obtains significant savings when compared to the costs of not implementing the
model for e-commerce customer support.
